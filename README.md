This is the home of the shared Emerson E&P Software Prettier config. For consistency this config should be used by all projects in E&P Software.

This config should normally be used in conjunction with [@emerson-eps/eslint-config](https://github.com/emerson-eps/eslint-config). Refer to that repository for instructions on using the two together.

## Usage

```
npm install --save-dev @emerson-eps/prettier-config
```

The simplest way to include the prettier config is to reference the shared prettier config in the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "prettier": "@emerson-eps/prettier-config"
}
```

Alternatively add a `.prettierrc.js` to the project, which is also a requirement if you need to override some of the [options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html), and import the module:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...require("@emerson-eps/prettier-config"),
  // Additional rules...
};
```

Try not to override the shared config unless you really need to. If you must override it please consider proposing the override as a change to this repository first to avoid divergence of code styles in different projects.

For further Prettier configuration help including precedence of configuration options consult the [Prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html).

## Integration with Visual Studio Code

If not already installed, install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension.
